# Learning With Langchain
Learning how to use LLMs such as ChatGPT-4 to enhance application development and research. Using [Langchain docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) and Deeplearning.ai's free [Langchain course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-for-llm-application-development/)

- [langchain_quickstart](./langchain_quckstart.ipynb) notebook uses the Langchain quickstart tutorial code to walk through different examples
- [mult_pdfs_qa](./mult_pdfs_qa.ipynb) gives an example of loading two different file types (.pdf, .txt) via DirectoryLoaders and using embeddings to create a vector store. With the vector store we use a LLM to perform question and answer retrieval on the documents.
